            Hi, I'm Connor! Currently, I am a user interface (UI) owner and Senior Software Engineer working on cloud-based applications in the healthcare industry. As the front-end team lead, I constantly connect with the front-end team, back-end team, and others including systems, service, security, reliability, architects, product managers and consuming stakeholders to ensure the product meets the usersâ€™ requirements and is delivered on time and with a robust and maintainable implementation. I am a great addition to your team with my ability to learn new technologies and problem solve quickly, plan reliably, collaborate flexibly, and lead and mentor others. I keep focus on the users and maintain high testing standards for low defect rates. I get feedback and start delivering results early utilizing Figma for iterative wireframe design and AI and generated code to increase velocity. I have recently delivered the UI for the first two releases of a high impact application which enables subscription-based revenue and reduces application order fulfilment time from weeks to days. I worked on the project throughout the development lifecycle from proof of concept through component and system verification for the first two releases while pulling in improvements from feedback. I regularly practice skills in planning for sprints and program increments in the Scrum environment. I often implement front-end code and use component libraries, write documentation, review merge requests, write unit tests and behavioral driven development (BDD) tests, and close out defects and security vulnerabilities. I have experience with Angular, Node JS, AWS, Cucumber, python, Docker, and Kubernetes and can pick up new technologies quickly. I have valuable knowledge outside of software development that helps me work cross functionally as well. I have experience with data analytics, project management, and intellectual property including filing two patents (detector enclosure, detector structure).
